# ReduxFlakes

Welcome! My name is ReduxFlakes and I do web and Android app development projects. I'm a computer science student focused on FOSS, and privacy related topics who loves collaborating with others on open source projects, and the old/indie web! I also **LOVE** music!

## Skills

My language stack includes C, Java, and almost nothing of Python. I also have experience with web development using HTML, CSS, 11ty, Astro, and Jekyll.

I'm currently taking my second GPI degree which includes Java and PHP.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked/contributed on:

- [My Website](https://reduxflakes.neocities.org) | Built with 11ty
- [SurfScape](https://github.com/SurfScape) | _Your friendly Neocities web portal_ - built using 11ty and Nunjucks
