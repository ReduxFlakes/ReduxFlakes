# ReduxFlakes

Hey ðŸ‘‹, my name is ReduxFlakes and I do web and Android app development. 
I'm a computer science student focused on FOSS, and privacy related topics who loves collaborating with others with the same ideas, and the old/indie web! I also love [music](https://www.last.fm/user/ReduxFlakes).

## Skills

In terms of programming I mostly work with Java & Kotlin, I also know HTML, CSS, and JS for web development. I also have experience with Git, GitHub, Eleventy, Android Studio/Intellij, VS Code, Python, and Windows.

I also have experience with design and other creative hobbies with the usage of tools like Figma, Penpot, Obsidian, Audacity, and FL Studio.
