## Skills

I mostly do web nowadays with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/), I also know Android development with [Jepack Compose](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose). Currently I want to try develop apps for Windows (desktop in general) and after the failure that was making something on WinForms responsive I decided to go learn more about Node.JS, especially Electron and Tauri to build apps with web technologies.
I'm currently learning more about JavaScript and other web related utilities like [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and returning to [Astro](https://astro.build/) I'm also thinking of learning Rust and Python as I feel those will be really nice to work with in the future.

I also have experience with Git, GitHub, Linux, Networking (not a lot), Windows, and Android.

### Other Skills

Figma, Penpot, Obsidian, Audacity, Discord, and FL Studio.
