## Skills

### General Programming/Coding

I mostly work with the web nowadays with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) with the [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) templating language. I also currently do Android development with Java/Kotlin and currently learning [Jepack Compose](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose) and [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/). I'm also learning other web related utilities like [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and currently trying to learn Rust to build Windows apps using [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) together with SvelteKit.

I've also used [Python](https://www.python.org/) to build Discord bots, [Sketchware](https://github.com/Sketchware-Pro/Sketchware-Pro) for Android Java app development, and [Astro](https://astro.build/) for websites in the past.

I also have experience with Git, GitHub, Android Studio/IntelliJ, Visual Studio Code, Windows, and Firefox.
